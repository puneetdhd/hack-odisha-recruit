## About HireVox  

HireVox is an **AI-powered recruitment platform** that streamlines the hiring journey — from resume parsing to AI-driven interviews and feedback generation. Recruiters simply provide a job description, and HireVox handles the rest: generating smart questions, scheduling interviews, conducting voice-based assessments, scoring candidates fairly, and preventing cheating through webcam anomaly detection and tab-switch monitoring. With real-time analytics, and voice verification, HireVox empowers companies to hire **faster, smarter, and without bias**.  
  

This project was developed by **Team CodeBlooded** and submitted for **HackOdisha + 2025**.

## Deployment on Akash

### Akash Wallet Address:

```bash
akash18czr8t9lmdvn8vwuzqxz63evy3s0z5t32gjrnc
```

- SDL File: See deploy.yml in the repo.

- The project is deployed and hosted using Akash Network for decentralized GPU cloud compute.

## Features  

-  **Resume Parsing & Ranking with AI**  
  Automatically extracts and ranks candidate resumes to save recruiters hours of manual work.  

-  **AI-Powered Interview (Voice)**  
  Conducts structured interviews in real-time using AI voice agents, ensuring consistent and unbiased questioning.  

-  **Voice Verification**  
  Matches candidate’s voice with pre-recorded samples to verify identity and prevent impersonation during interviews.  

-  **Smart Scoring & Feedback**  
  Analyzes candidate responses, generates unbiased scores, and provides recruiters with structured feedback and recommendations.  

-  **Recruiter Dashboard with Analytics**  
  Centralized dashboard to view candidate rankings, insights, and hiring metrics.    

-  **Cheat Prevention & Anomaly Detection**  
  - Warns candidates if they switch tabs twice; ends interview on the third attempt.  
  - Uses **webcam anomaly detection** to flag unusual activities (e.g., multiple faces, frequent distractions, mobile usage).

## Workflow / How It Works  

### Recruiter Side  
1. Enters job title, description, interview duration, and question type.  
2. AI generates interview questions (editable by recruiter).  
3. Recruiter shares interview link via email/dashboard.  
4. Receives candidate reports with AI-generated scores, feedback & recommendations.  

### Candidate Side  
1. Opens interview link → fills name, email, and uploads resume.  
2. AI generates role + resume-specific questions.  
3. Candidate joins full-screen AI interview (voice/chat).  
4. System verifies candidate’s voice to prevent impersonation.  
5. Responses analyzed → feedback & scoring generated.  
6. Cheating prevention system monitors tab-switching and webcam anomalies.
